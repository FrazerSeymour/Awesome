# Frazer's Awesome WM Configuration

## About
Exactly what it says on the tin, this repo contains a copy of '~/.config/awesome/', and a Python script that copies my changes and commits for me. The master branch works with my main desktop computer, there will be a 'pi' branch that is compatible with my Raspberry Pi.

## Dependencies
My `rc.lua` references the following programs:
* xcompmgr		for transparent terminals
* rxvt-unicode	terminal of choice
* gvim			editor of choice
* chromium		browser of choice
* kde			I run the WiFi plasmoid in a window
* ksnapshot		mapped to PrtScn

## Old Repo History
I originally stored my configuration in an Hg repo on BitBucket. I tried exporting the repo, but to no avail, so my first few commits are unavailable here. If they are ever needed, the old repo is still up at this link: https://bitbucket.org/FrazerS/awesome-stuff

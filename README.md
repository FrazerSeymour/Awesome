# Frazer's Awesome WM Repo

## About
Exactly what it says on the tin, this repo contains a copy of my Awesome Window Manager configurations, themes, and plugins. The master branch works with my main desktop computer (originally openSUSE running KDE), there will be a 'pi' branch that is compatible with my Raspberry Pi (also openSUSE).

## Dependencies
My `rc.lua` references the following programs:
* **xcompmgr** - for transparent terminals
* **rxvt-unicode** - terminal of choice
* **gvim** - editor of choice
* **chromium** - browser of choice
* **kde** - I run the WiFi plasmoid in a window
* **ksnapshot** - mapped to PrtScn
* **kcalc** - mapped to calculator button

## Old Repo History
I originally stored my configuration in an Hg repo on BitBucket. I tried exporting the repo, but to no avail, so my first few commits are unavailable here. If they are ever needed, the old repo is still up at this link: https://bitbucket.org/FrazerS/awesome-stuff

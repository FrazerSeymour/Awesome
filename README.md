# Frazer's Awesome WM Repo

## About
Exactly what it says on the tin, this repo contains a copy of my Awesome Window Manager configurations, themes, and plugins.

Note that the master branch is only used as is on openSUSE 13.1 (and its packaged version of Awesome and the other programs mentioned below), so will probably not work on your machine without some (possibly major) tweaks.

## Dependencies
My `rc.lua` references the following programs:
* **xcompmgr** - for transparent terminals
* **rxvt-unicode** - terminal of choice
* **gvim** - editor of choice
* **chromium** - browser of choice
* **kde** - I run the WiFi plasmoid in a window
* **ksnapshot** - mapped to PrtScn
* **kcalc** - mapped to calculator button

## Old Repo History
I originally stored my configuration in an Hg repo on BitBucket. I tried exporting the repo, but to no avail, so my first few commits are unavailable here. If they are ever needed, the old repo is still up at this link: https://bitbucket.org/FrazerS/awesome-stuff

# Frazer's Awesome WM Repo

## About
Exactly what it says on the tin, this repo contains a copy of my Awesome Window Manager configurations, themes, and plugins.

This config is used as-is on my Arch Linux machines, using the latest releases of everything from the pacman repos.

## Dependencies
My `rc.lua` references the following programs:
* **xcompmgr** - for transparent terminals
* **rxvt-unicode** - terminal of choice
* **gvim** - editor of choice
* **chromium** - browser of choice
* **wicd-gtk** - WiFi manager of choice.
* **shutter** - mapped to PrtScn
* **galculator** - mapped to calculator button
* **SpiderOak**, **KeePass**, and **kdocker** - password manager stack
* **SparkleShare** - when I'm too lazy to sync git repos

## Old Repo History
I originally stored my configuration in an Hg repo on BitBucket. I tried exporting the repo, but to no avail, so my first few commits are unavailable here. If they are ever needed, the old repo is still up at this link: https://bitbucket.org/FrazerS/awesome-stuff
